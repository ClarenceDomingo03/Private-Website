    <p>When I look back at my life, the person who inspires me the most isn’t someone I’ve met or someone famous. It’s the younger version of myself—the person I used to be before all the pressures of life weighed me down. I’m not talking about my childhood, but rather the version of me who was still full of dreams, energy, and hope, before life started to feel more complicated. This younger version of myself holds lessons I still try to live by.</p>
	<p>I remember when I was younger, everything seemed so simple. I didn’t think too much about failure, about success, or about what others expected of me. There was just this unshakable belief that everything was possible. I believed that I could do whatever I wanted to do, and I was willing to try anything. I remember having so much energy, running around, trying new things, and getting lost in the joy of being alive.</p>
	<p>One of the things I loved most back then was playing sports—especially basketball and volleyball. Sports were my escape, my place of freedom. I didn’t worry about being the best player. I didn’t care about the scores or whether we won or lost. What mattered was the feeling of being part of something, the thrill of chasing after the ball, and the laughter that came from being with friends. I didn’t care about how I looked or what people thought. I just played because I loved it.</p>
	<p>But as I grew older, things changed. Life started getting more serious. School became harder, expectations grew, and I started caring more about what others thought of me. It became easy to lose touch with that carefree, fearless version of myself who played just for the love of it. The pressure to succeed, the fear of failure, and the self-doubt that came with growing up sometimes made it hard to remember that simpler time when everything was possible.</p>
	<p>Yet, whenever I look back at my younger self, I realize that he knew something I forgot along the way. He didn’t care about being perfect. He didn’t worry about the future or the mistakes that might come. He just focused on the present moment, on enjoying life and doing what he loved. The older version of me, weighed down by all the worries and expectations, sometimes needs to be reminded of that.</p>
	<p>Whenever I’m feeling overwhelmed or unsure about my path, I think back to those moments when I was younger. I remember how I didn’t overthink things. I didn’t fear failure because I saw it as a part of learning and growing. I remember how easy it was to find joy in the little things, like playing a game of volleyball with friends or shooting hoops with no agenda other than having fun. That’s what I want to hold on to now—the freedom to enjoy life without always worrying about the outcome.</p>
	<p>I wish I could be more like that younger version of me, someone who didn’t hesitate, who jumped into every challenge with excitement, and who found happiness in the simplest moments. I realize now that life doesn’t have to be so heavy. If I could channel that energy and optimism again, maybe I could approach life with more joy and less fear.</p>
	<p>Looking back at my younger self, I see that the lessons I learned during those carefree days are still with me, even if they’re buried beneath the stress and responsibilities of adulthood. I remind myself that it’s okay to fail, that it’s okay to be imperfect, and that the most important thing is to keep moving forward. Just like my younger self, I want to keep playing, keep dreaming, and keep believing that anything is possible.</p>
	<p>So, when life gets tough, or when I feel lost, I try to remember that younger version of me—the one who knew how to live in the moment, who found joy in the little things, and who believed that everything was possible. And I hold on to that belief, because I know that, deep down, it’s still a part of who I am today.
